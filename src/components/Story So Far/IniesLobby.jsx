          p1={`Robin and Franky were taken by CP9 and arrived at Enies Lobby, the island of justice. 
            There, CP9's Jabra, Kumadori, Owl, and CP9's director, Spandam, were waiting for Lucci's 
            return. On the other hand, Sanji and Luffy, who joined Sogeking, also arrive at the island. 
            Luffy defeated 10,000 Marines alone and broke through the siege. CP9's Bruno stands in the 
            way, but Luffy defeats him with his new technique "Gear 2 (Second)".`}
          p2={`Friends who fight hard to save Robin. However, Robin refuses their hand, saying, 
            "I already want to die!" Robin has been chased by the world government since he was a child 
            because he can read the "historical text (Poneglyph)", and has lived in a world where 
            betrayal is commonplace. Because he is by his side, his "important companion" continues to 
            be targeted by the world government, and because of that, they may one day abandon him. 
            That's what scared Robin the most.`}
          p3={`Hearing this, Luffy has Sogeking shoot out the flag of the World Government. It was 
            Luffy's "declaration of war" against the World Government, which had been harassing his 
            comrades. Robin, who has been denied the possibility of living until now, learns that his 
            friends are trying to save him from the bottom of his heart, and for the first time, he 
            says, "I want to live."`}
          p4={`The Straw Hats challenge CP9 to free Robin. Zoro and his friends managed to defeat CP9, 
            even though they were forced into a tough fight due to its high fighting ability. All that's 
            left is Luffy and Lucci's decisive battle. However, in the middle of that, Spandam 
            accidentally requests a "Buster Call". Luffy activates his trump card, "Gear 3 (Third)", 
            as the naval fleet bombards Enies Lobby. Furthermore, with "Gear 2", he used all of his 
            remaining strength and finally defeated Lucci.`}
          p5={`Despite winning CP9, the Straw Hats are surrounded by a naval fleet and cornered. 
            However, at that time, a mysterious voice called "Look down" arrives. Friends who follow 
            the voice and jump into the sea. Waiting there was the Merry, which should have disappeared 
            into the stormy sea in Water Seven. Luffy boarded the Merry, broke through the naval siege, 
            and escaped from Enies Lobby.`}

            role. Luffy decides to see off the Merry when Iceberg tells him to put him to sleep. The 
            "voice" of the Merry reaches Luffy and the others who watch the ship being enveloped in 
            flames. It was a word of thanks to the 'friends' who had cherished him all this time.`}
          p7={`After returning to Water Seven, Luffy and his friends ask Franky to build a new ship 
            for them. However, at that moment, Vice Admiral Garp, who is said to be a hero of the navy, 
            visits Luffy with his subordinates Coby, Helmeppo and others. The friends are shocked to 
            learn that Garp is Luffy's grandfather. Furthermore, it is revealed that the mysterious man 
            who helped Luffy in Loguetown, the 'world's worst criminal' and 'revolutionary' Dragon, is 
            Luffy's biological father.`}
          p8={`Even Luffy had never heard of this fact. Luffy and Coby are happy to meet again after 
            a long time. When they parted, Luffy and his friends vowed to meet again in the "New World",

          p9={`A few days later, along with the report of the completion of the ship, the news that 
            "everyone" of the Straw Hat Crew has been awarded a bounty. The new wanted letter also 
            included Frankie's name. Luffy invites Franky to join him, but Franky declines the invitation 
            because he believes it is his mission to protect Water Seven. However, persuaded by Iceberg 
            and his family's younger brothers, he decided to board the Straw Hat Pirates' ship as a 
            'shipwright'. And Usopp, who was unable to return to the crew due to the fight, apologized 
            and said, "Please let me join again," and was welcomed back into the crew. `}
