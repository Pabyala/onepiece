          p1={`At Marineford, where the Navy has its headquarters, the public execution of Portgas D. Ace, 
            the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates, has been decided.`}
          p2={`The Navy executes Ace, the son of the "Pirate King" Roger, and cuts off his loathsome blood. 
            Whitebeard, who will never allow his comrades to die, leads a pirate fleet into Marineford. 
            The two major powers of the World Government, the Navy HQ and the Seven Warlords of the Sea, 
            are attacking. An unprecedented battle broke out in history, where the times would change no 
            matter who wins or loses.`}
          p3={`Whitebeard possesses the ability of "wobbly", which is said to be "the power that can 
            destroy the world". Its power was overwhelming, but the navy, which has the "three generals" 
            and the Shichibukai, which are the greatest strength of the navy headquarters, is not defeated, 
            and the back and forth battle continues.`}
          p4={`In the midst of this, Luffy and his friends rush in with an escaped prisoner from Impel 
            Down. The battle becomes more and more confusing. In order to break through the situation, the 
            navy deploys the powerful weapon "Pacifista". Furthermore, he succeeded in inflicting a mortal 
            wound on Whitebeard by persuading Squard, a maelstrom spider, a pirate affiliated with 
            Whitebeard, to stab Whitebeard.`}
          p5={`On the other hand, Luffy is single-mindedly aiming for the ace of the execution platform. 
            Although he struggled against the Shichibukai and the navy elite who stood in his way, he 
            finally succeeded in releasing Ace with the support of Whitebeard, Marco and other Whitebeard 
            Pirates captains, and Ivankov and other Impel Down prison breakout groups.`}

          p6={`"Everyone!! Be sure to live!!! Return to the new world safely!!!" Whitebeard, who realized 
            that he was about to die, issued his final "Captain's Order" and entrusted his companions with 
            the rest. Whitebeard risking his remaining life to assist his companions in escaping. However, 
            in the midst of this, Ace protects Luffy from an attack by Navy Admiral Akainu, who is pierced 
            through his stomach. Ace thanked his friends for loving him and died in Luffy's arms. Luffy 
            loses consciousness from the shock.`}
          p7={`While the battlefield is wrapped in further chaos, Blackbeard attacks with the world's 
            worst criminals released from Impel Down's lowest floor, LV6. Attack Whitebeard. Whitebeard, 
            who was attacked by Blackbeard and others, said at the end, "The 'Great Treasure in One Piece' 
            really exists!!!", and died.`}
          p8={`Blackbeard, who stole his power from the dead Whitebeard and obtained two mighty powers, 
            "Yamiyami" and "Gura Gura", declares the arrival of his own era and destroys the naval 
            headquarters.
            Nonetheless, neither the pirates nor the navy have abandoned their weapons, and the battle 
            turns into a quagmire. However, Marine Coby raises his voice to stop such a barren battle. 
            Akainu sees this act as a hindrance and throws down his fist, but there is no one to stop him. 
            It was Red-Haired Shanks, one of the Four Emperors. Shanks proposes to give swords to both the 
            navy and pirates, and Marshal Sengoku agrees. Thus, the biggest battle since the opening of the 
            "Great Age of Pirates", later called the "Marineford Paramount War", came to an end and was 
            deeply engraved in history.`}

            Sabo revive.`}

            has important friends. In order to meet his friends as soon as possible, Luffy is about to head 
            to the Sabaody Archipelago, but Rayleigh shows up and makes a proposal.
            After that, Luffy revisits Marineford with Rayleigh and Jinbei. The act quickly spread around 
            the world, but there was a hidden message for his scattered friends.`}
