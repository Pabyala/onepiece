          p1={`Two years have passed since the Paramount War between the Navy Headquarters, the "Royal 
            Seven Warlords of the Sea", and the Whitebeard Pirates. After completing his training on the 
            uninhabited island, Luffy heads to the promised land of Sabaody Archipelago with his friends. 
            At that time, the Sabaody Archipelago was buzzing with news of the revival of the Straw Hat Crew. 
            Rumors spread that the crew is looking for new members, and the Navy hears about it and begins 
            investigating.`}
          p2={`Unaware of such things, the Straw Hat Crew gather one after another. When Nami and Usopp 
            stop by at a bar, they run into "Three-tongued Demaro Black" who pretends to be Luffy and his 
            crew. Meanwhile, Luffy, who arrived late, mistook Black's subordinates for Zoro and Sanji, and 
            went with them to Globe 46. `}
          p3={`There, pirates who believed Black as 'Straw Hat Luffy' gathered together. Among them are 
            the well-known bounties, including the billion-dollar rookie “Wet-Haired Caribou”.`}
          p4={`Then, the navy led by Sentomaru appears to capture the Straw Hat Crew. Sentomaru sees it 
            as a "fake" at first sight and defeats Black with a single blow. Realizing that they have been 
            deceived, the pirates become agitated. Meanwhile, Pacifista, brought by Sentomaru, finds Luffy 
            in the crowd. However, Luffy easily dodges the attack and crushes the once-struggling Pacifista 
            with a single blow. Furthermore, Zoro and Sanji also rushed in, and they also defeated Pacifista 
            in an instant.`}
          p5={`"I will become the 'Pirate King'!!! I will become!!!!" Luffy proclaims that to Rayleigh, 
            who has come to see him off, and goes to Glove 42, where his friends are waiting. The Straw Hat 
            Pirates, who are reunited safely without missing anyone, depart for Fish-Man Island, the entrance 
            to the "New World."`}

          p6={`10,000 meters under the sea, the island "Fishman Island" is wrapped in a huge bubble. 
            Awaiting Luffy and the others there is the New Fishman Pirates led by Hody Jones. The group 
            breaks through the siege network that is approaching them to become subordinates and makes a 
            landing. However, when Sanji sees the beautiful mermaids, he is so excited that he begins to 
            bleed his nose too much, causing him to bleed profusely. Chopper asks the fishmen for a blood 
            transfusion, but no one cooperates. On this island, it was forbidden for fishmen to share their 
            blood with humans.`}
          p7={`Sanji also recovers after receiving blood from human pirates. And there, King Neptune 
            appears and invites everyone to Ryugu Castle. There, Luffy meets Shirahoshi, the mermaid
            princess of the royal family.`}
          p8={`By chance, Luffy ended up working with her, but due to a misunderstanding, he was made a 
            kidnapper who kidnapped the princess.`}
          p9={`Meanwhile, Hody puts his long-held plan into action. He hates humans and plans to overthrow 
            the royal family that wants to coexist with humans. Hody, who sees the time as ripe, joins 
            forces with the fish-man pirate Vander Decken IX, who is after Shirahoshi, and initiates a coup 
            d'état.`}

          p10={`Hody, who has captured King Neptune and his sons' princes, declares that they will be 
            publicly executed in the square. Luffy and his friends, who knew it, stormed the square to 
            save them. There are 100,000 new fish-man pirates led by Hody. On the other hand, there are only 
            10 Straw Hat Pirates, including Jinbei. However, Luffy annihilated half of them in an instant 
            with "Haki of Haoh Color". `}
          p11={`His friends also demonstrate the power they have acquired over the past two years, 
            defeating enemies one after another and overwhelming the executives.`}
          p12={`In the midst of this, Vander Decken activates his own ability and makes a violent move by 
            launching the "Old Ark Noah" towards Shirahoshi. Hody drops Noah on Fish-Man Island and plots 
            to destroy the island.`}
          p13={`After a fierce battle, Luffy defeats Hody and tries to destroy the falling Noah, but the 
            hull is too huge. However, in the next moment, when it seemed like it was all up to now, giant 
            sea kings lifted Noah up, avoiding a collision with Fish-Man Island.
            Luffy collapses with a lot of blood due to the injuries he received in the battle. While the 
            fish people are appreciative of Luffy, he hesitates to accept a blood transfusion, but Jinbe 
            comes forward and shares his own blood. It was proof that fish-man and man could hold hands.`}

          p15={`In addition, Luffy and his friends learn that Akainu has been appointed as the new marshal 
            of the navy from Jinbei, and that Blackbeard, who has increased his power, is now positioned as 
            one of the "four emperors".`}
          p16={`In the midst of this, Baron Tamago and Pekoms, who are subordinates of the "Four Emperors" 
            Big Mom, visit Fish-Man Island. The purpose is to collect the sweets that Fish-Man Island gave

          p17={`However, the sweets factory was destroyed in the previous battle, and the sweets to pay 
            were not prepared. "If you can't prepare sweets, Fishman Island will be destroyed." Upon hearing 
            this, Luffy pretended that he had eaten all the sweets and declared that Fish-Man Island would 
            be his territory. He goes straight to Big Mom and declares war.`}
