          p1={`Miss All Sunday, Nico Robin, whose life was saved by Luffy in Alabasta. 
            Luffy takes an interest in her and joins her as her new companion. Although they 
            escaped a direct hit, Luffy and his friends were robbed of the record (log) 
            of the "Log Pose" by "Sorashima". He immediately sets "Sky Island" as his 
            next destination and sets out to search for clues in the sunken galleon ship, 
            but there he encounters Masira who has come to salvage.`}
          p2={`Based on the "recording guidelines" stolen from Masira, the group heads 
            to an island called Jaya. When he landed in Mocktown, a town in the west of the 
            island, it was a lawless area infested with vicious pirates, including Bellamy 
            the Hyena. Luffy and the others get into a fight with Bellamy at a bar they 
            stop by to gather information.`}
          p3={`However, Luffy tells Zoro, "Don't buy this fight!!!"
          After leaving Mocktown, Luffy and his friends visit Montblanc Cricket, a 
          descendant of "Liar Noland", based on the information Robin has gathered. 
          Cricket has been searching for the "sinking gold city" that his ancestors saw. 
          Hearing from him about the existence of a "knock-up stream" to go to Sky Island, 
          the group immediately began preparations.`}
          p4={`However, while Luffy and the others were away, the Bellamy gang, aiming 
            for gold bars, attacked Cricket. Knowing this, Luffy punched Bellamy alone and 
            crushed it with a single blow. Recover the cricket gold nuggets. Then, the party 
            rides the rushing ocean current and departs for Sky Island Skypia.`}

          p5={`As soon as they reach the "Sky Sea", Luffy and his friends are attacked 
            by a masked man, and are rescued by Sky Knight Gun Fall in a dangerous place. 
            After that, we passed through the Gate of Heaven and arrived at Angel Beach. 
            The Straw Hat Pirates meet Conis and Pagaya and enjoy the sky island, but they
            are sentenced as criminals by the God Corps that suddenly appears. Ruled by 
            the one and only God, Eneru, Skypiea has strict laws, and those who violate 
            them will be judged as criminals.`}
          p6={`The punishment given to Luffy and his friends, who resisted the God Corps 
            and became second-class criminals, is "Heaven's Judgment" in the Holy Land. In 
            order to rescue Zoro, Nami, Chopper, and Robin, who were kidnapped to the 
            "altar of sacrifice" together with the Merry, Luffy, Usopp, and Sanji head 
            to the holy land "God's Island (Upper Yard)".`}

          p7={`Luffy and his friends, who came to the "God's Island", challenge the "Jade 
            Trial" out of four trials. One of the four priests who serve Eneru, 'Satori of 
            the Forest', who is at the mercy of 'Mantra,' who can foresee the opponent's 
            movements, but joins forces and defeats him.`}
          p8={`Around that time, Zoro and his friends go out to explore the island and 
            find out that the "God's Island" is actually the "half of Jaya" that was once 
            torn apart. The Golden Land that Noland witnessed and was thought to have sunk 
            to the bottom of the sea, was this "God's Island". Chopper was left alone at 
            the altar to watch over the Merry, but the priest Skyrider Shura appears there. 
            Gan Fall is summoned by Chopper and rushes to the rescue, but is defeated after 
            a fierce battle.`}
          p9={`After that, the Straw Hat Pirates, who have safely joined up, unravel the 
            mystery hidden in Norland's logbook and find out where the gold is. The next 
            morning, we set out to find gold. On the other hand, "Shandia", who has been 
            fighting as a guerrilla to regain his "hometown", launches an all-out attack 
            to avenge Eneru. Eneru, who expected this, ordered his subordinates to intercept 
            him. The Straw Hat Pirates, Shandia, and the God Corps led by Eneru begin a 
            three-way survival scene.`}

          p10={`Luffy is swallowed by a giant snake (Uwabami) while people drop out one after another in the intensifying battle. Furthermore, Eneru himself participates in the war, and the battle becomes extremely melee. In front of Zoro and the others who survived the battle, Eneru declares that he will "drag all humans down from the sky and aim for the legendary land of the Infinite Earth (Fairyverse)."`}
          p11={`Zoro and his friends challenge Eneru to a fight, but they fall helplessly before the overwhelming power of the "Rumbling Fruit", which can freely manipulate lightning. Nami, who escaped the attack alone, chooses to follow Eneru in order to escape from this predicament.`}
          p12={`Eneru boarded the flying ark "Maxim" and set out to destroy Skypiea. After escaping from the serpent's body, Luffy chases after the Shandia girl Aisa, relying on her "heart rope". Luffy had a huge golden ball attached to his arm by Eneru, but he corners Eneru with the power of Gum, the "natural enemy" of lightning.`}
          p13={`And finally, a blow of the whole body catches Eneru. The blow struck the "Golden Bell", and the crickets who heard the sound of the bell learned that the "Golden Land" actually existed. After the battle, the "Sky People" and the Shandia reconciled, ending the 400-year conflict between the two.`}  
          p14={`After the feast, Robin deciphers the "historical text (Poneglyph)" engraved on the pedestal of the bell, and learns of the existence of the ancient weapon "Poseidon" with the name of God. In addition, a message from Pirate King Roger was also left in the "text of history". Luffy and the others were sent away by the sound of the bells ringing by the Shandia and the others, leaving Sky Island behind.`}
